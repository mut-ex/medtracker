# meditracker
A simple, straightforward and useful medication tracking web app. It has the following features:
- **Time-Specific Reminders**: Provides specific times for taking each medication, ensuring users do not miss any doses.

- **Dosage Information**: Each medication entry includes the dosage, which helps users take the correct amount.

- **Medication Form Icons**: Icons next to each medication indicate the form (e.g., pill, inhaler), making it easier to identify.

- **Color-Coding**: Different colors are used for different medications, helping users quickly distinguish between them.

- **Taken Indicator**: The user can tap on any medication and mark it as taken or not-taken. They can also enter the exact time the medication was taken. This information is also added to the medication card, providing a clear visual confirmation.

- **Medication List Presented As A Timeline**: Due to time sensitive dosage of most medications, the list is presented in the form of a timeline.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and easy-to-read layout, which is important for users with visual impairments or cognitive difficulties.

- **Long-term Tracking**: The medication tracking information is stored locally; this allows the user to go back and view their log from days past.

The following features haven't been implemented (yet):
- Ability to add and modifiy medications, doses, and schedule from the front-end.
- Ability to view long-term tracking information in the form of a chart/graph to see trends at a glance.
